# Configure WireGuard VPN Clients

[WireGuard VPN clients](https://www.wireguard.com/install/) are available for Windows, macOS, iOS and Android.

To add a VPN connection, open the WireGuard App on your mobile device, tap the "Add" button, then scan the generated QR code in the script output. For Windows and macOS, first securely transfer the generated `.conf` file to your computer, then open WireGuard and import the file.

To manage WireGuard VPN clients, run the install script again: `sudo bash wireguard.sh`.

Step-by-step instructions to configure and manage WireGuard VPN clients can be found in the following books:
